# Vega-Lite Plugin

[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is an interactive charting library that uses a well-known declarative syntax for defining charts known as "Grammar of Graphics".

See the Vega-Lite website for many examples of typical data visualizations that are possible: the usual bar-charts, scatterplots, and much more are possible.

## Usage

A file named `*.vega.json` must be present in working folder. Each json file matching that pattern will produce a separate Vega-Lite diagram.

**DATA** can either be an array of hard-coded values (see `example.vega.json`) or a URL pointing to a JSON file containing an array.

- If the URL is pointing to a file in the local filestorage, this plugin will load it directly and embed the data in the object automatically.
- If the URL is a fully-qualified URL, the Vega library will load it on its own.

**AUTOSIZE** must be set as in the example below for the charts to be responsive to window size changes.

**WIDTH** and **HEIGHT** can be hardcoded to pixel sizes, but a width set to `container` will be responsive. Height needs to be specified.
