title: About Visualizations
---

The advanced visualizations in this section are not designed to be included in dashboards, but rather are full-screen and immersive. Thus they cannot be part of `dashboard-*` YAML files.

Instead, each advanced visualization has a speficic YAML file type of its own, and the presence of that file in a folder will trigger the availability of the visualization, identifiable by a clickable thumbnail in the folder browser.

Most of these visualizations are designed with MATSim model outputs in mind; but any disaggregate data of the correct format, no matter how it was generated, should generally be adaptable.
