_A flow map of San Francisco_

Flowmaps depict _aggregate movements_ between origins and destinations.

## Usage

Flow maps can only be included as panels in **Dashboards**. See Dashboard documentation for general tips on creating dashboard configurations.

- Each chart panel is defined inside a **row** in a `dashboard-*.yaml` file.
- Standard title, description, height, and width fields define the frame.
