title: Developing SimWrapper
---

This page details **build instructions** for setting up your own instance of a SimWrapper website. This is for developers who want to build and extend SimWrapper.

- If you are only interested in _using SimWrapper_ -- whether the official [TU Berlin SimWrapper](https://vsp.berlin/simwrapper) or your own team's version of it -- then _you do not need to read this page._
- Read [this introduction](simwrapper-intro.md) instead, or go straight to the [dashboard guide](dashboards.md).

## Foundational technologies

You will need to know this tech in order to hack on this website. If you already know Python, learning TypeScript/Javascript is not that huge of a leap, but it will definitely take some time to learn the full stack.

- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - typesafe Javascript. And if you don't know Javascript, you probably want to learn that first
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - the glue that connects UI elements to code. Similar to React but lightweight and awesome
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) - the template language used in our Vue files, far easier than writing bare HTML. You really only need Pug [tags](https://pugjs.org/language/tags.html) and [attributes](https://pugjs.org/language/attributes.html)
- [Deck.gl](https://deck.gl) - WebGL library for the fancy animations.

## Setting up your development environment

All tooling and source code is entirely free! You can build and hack on SimWrapper without purchasing anything. The site uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for build & dependency management, and was developed using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Install [the latest "LTS" Version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. The following VS Code plugins are required. Find them in the VS Code plugin directory.
   - **Prettier** to force code-style consistency
   - **Vetur**, the official Vue plugin.

## First time build

Fork or clone the Github source repository, and then use the `npm` node package manager to install all of the javascript dependency libraries. The main SimWrapper source repo is at <https://github.com/simwrapper/simwrapper> but _you may want to clone a different repo_ if you are working on a different project such as [ActivitySim](https://github.com/ActivitySim/dashboard) or the [SFCTA model](https://github.com/sfcta/simwrapper)

1. Clone the repo:

- `git clone https://github.com/simwrapper/simwrapper # or your fork`
- `cd simwrapper`

2. Install node dependencies

- `npm ci`
- This will spew lots of warnings but should ultimately finish without hard errors

Congrats! You now have SimWrapper installed and you are ready to start hacking! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨

## Development Commands

**npm run serve** -- Build and run a local copy of the site. This is the main command you will use to start up the dev server, hack on your changes in VS Code, and see the results. `npm run serve` runs a local server with hot reload for testing, which usually listens on http://localhost:8080

**npm run build** -- Compile and minify the build for production. This command builds in "production mode", which performs some optimizations, shakes out unused libraries, and catches some build-time errors. You probably want to run this before you push anything live.

**npm run test:unit** -- Run unit tests. Ahahaha well... I have not written tests ðŸ‘½ but the infrastructure is there to use `jest`.

## Hosting on Github (and other places)

You've done all this work and you want your copy of SimWrapper to be live on the internet? Yay that is exciting!

**Github Pages:** Here's how to use Github Pages to publish the site.

Github pages allows you to publish static content (like SimWrapper) from any repository you own. You place the built files in a special `gh-pages` branch; the existence of that branch triggers Github to start serving the files from your repository at the url `my-github-userid.github.io/myrepo`. Thus if you were Github user "billyc" and you forked the repo into a repo called 'simwrapper' then it will be hosted at {billyc}.github.io/simwrapper

We wrote a deploy script that builds and pushes to Github Pages. Follow these instructions to use it:

1. First, edit the file `package.json` and modify the `deploy` line in the "scripts" section to make it match your userid/repository, e.g. `billyc/simwrapper` -- DO NOT try to push to simwrapper/simwrapper thx :-)

2. Run `npm run build` to ensure that your site builds without any hard errors. The build goes into a folder named `dist`. Fix any errors and keep running this until it builds!

3. Run `npm run deploy` to rebuild the `dist` folder and, if successful, it will then force-push the contents to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, overwriting any previous copy of the built site (don't worry the source code will remain safe on the master branch). In a couple moments your site will be live! Woot.

**Non-Github Pages:** If you want to deploy somewhere other than Github Pages, use `npm run build` to create the production build in `dist` as above. You can push the entirety of that folder to any static web host that you like, using their publishing tools.

## Project Layout

- `/scripts`: Housekeeping scripts go here. Most of these are used for postprocessing model results, written in Python, and also some build scripts are found here.
- `/src`: all TypeScript and Vue files go here
  - `/src/assets`: images, .CSVs, etc that get packaged by the build process go here
  - `/src/charts`: Dashboard chart types go here. Each chart type is a separate Vue component.
  - `/src/components`: shared Vue components go here, there are lots of them
  - `/src/js`: some typscript utility classes
  - `/src/layers`: shared deck.gl layer files go here. These are generally written in JSX.
  - `/src/plugins`: Each visualization plugin type gets its own folder here. To create your own plugin, copy one of these, rename its folder and main .vue file, and register it in `pluginRegistry.ts`. Read the plugin developer guide for details.
  - `/src/views`: The Vue pages that render various site pages such as the home page. Vue pages are registered in `/src/router.ts`
- `/public`: These files are pushed as-is by the build process; they are not packaged in any way. They end up in the root folder '/' of the built site.

Good luck and thanks for the help! -- [Billy](https://github.com/billyc)
