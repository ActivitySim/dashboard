_Scatterplot and horizontal box plot_

[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is an interactive charting library that uses a well-regarded declarative syntax for defining charts known as "Grammar of Graphics".

See the Vega-Lite website for many examples of typical data visualizations that are possible: the usual bar-charts, scatterplots, and much more are possible.

**NOTE:** For simple bar, area, and line charts, you will probably be better off using the simple charts defined in [Bar, Area, and Line Charts](bar-area-line)

## Usage

A file named `*.vega.json` must be present in working folder. Each json file matching that pattern will produce a separate Vega-Lite diagram.

**DATA** can either be an array of hard-coded values (see `example.vega.json`) or a URL pointing to a file containing an array of JSON or CSV data as in `movies.vega.json`. The file format is guessed based on the file extension.

See [Data in Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/data.html) for the full story on what data types are supported by Vega.

- If the URL is pointing to a file in the local filestorage, the plugin will load it directly and embed the data in the object automatically.
- If the URL is a fully-qualified URL, the Vega library will load it on its own.

**AUTOSIZE** must be set as in the example below for the charts to be responsive to window size changes.

**WIDTH** and **HEIGHT** can be hardcoded to pixel sizes, but a width set to `container` will be responsive. Height needs to be specified.
